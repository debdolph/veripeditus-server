How to contribute to Veripeditus
================================

State of the project
--------------------

Veripeditus is a project in a very early stage. While we are planning to
release a first preview in November 2016, things may be changing a lot
and we do not have a real roadmap yet. However, there are quite a few
things that are well-defined and the scope is clearly known. So if you
want to contribute, feel free to do so!

Steps to contribute
-------------------

 1. FInd something you want to do in the issue tracker.
 2. Read the issue description and any comments carefully.
 3. Try looking at the relevant sources.
 4. Ask any questions that may arise.
 5. Take feedback into account and start hacking!

Code style, contribution guidelines, etc.
-----------------------------------------

As strange as this may sound, technical debt is planned into the
Veripeditus development at this stage. We want to explore what can be
done and produce something that works and can be shown. After the first
preview release, we will tidy up (yes, we will - no further development
will take place until we really did!).

That means that you do not have to worry too much about the code you
contribute, as long as it is cool.

A note on libraries
-------------------

Please try to avoid adding dependncies if possible. If you really need
to add a dependency, please try to use something that is available as a
Debian package. If you can't, please discuss the problem in the issue
you are working on!
